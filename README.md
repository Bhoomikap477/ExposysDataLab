A Mass-Mail Dispatcher serves as a powerful marketing tool for brands, facilitating the simultaneous delivery of promotional messages to numerous recipients. It plays a pivotal role in brand promotion, product sales, and relationship building. This project report focuses on the development of a web-based Mass-Mail Dispatcher system designed to streamline the process of sending mass emails through personal computers.

The primary functionality of the system involves enabling users to dispatch mass emails to multiple recipients at specified times. Operating through a user-friendly interface, the application allows users to upload recipient lists via CSV files, providing a convenient means to send a single message to thousands of individuals on a mailing list.
